Plan 9 hoc(1) backported to Unix. This is updated version
from the one found in The Unix Programming Environment,
by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike (Addison-Wesley, 1984).

This version of hoc(1) needs C99 math functions in libc,
but otherwise should compile with C89 compilers as well.

Changes since the 4th edition of Plan 9 version:

- Results are 15 digits by default but variable PREC can
be used to override this.

- Added INF, NAN, isinf() and isnan().

- Changed output format to use %G instead of %g so that any
  INF or NAN in output is also valid input, without having to
  support lower case builtin variable names ('inf' and 'nan').
